üéµ Spotify API Fetcher

+++++ FOR SPOTIFY USER DATA +++++

I chose this project to dive deeper into working with external APIs, particularly one I personally use and enjoy. Spotify's API offered a great opportunity to combine my interest in music with Python, while learning about OAuth authentication and structured data extraction.

This Python script uses the Spotify Web API to authenticate a user and fetch personal Spotify data, such as profile information, playlists, and top tracks. It serves as the foundational step for a more advanced playlist and track scraper.

Great for understanding how OAuth 2.0 works in real applications

Useful introduction to working with third-party APIs

Bridges personal interest with technical learning

üöÄ Features:

Authenticate with the Spotify API using OAuth 2.0

Fetch and display user profile information (e.g., display name, user ID)

Retrieve and display playlist names and top 5 tracks

Lays groundwork for playlist and track data scraping

üì¶ Requirements:

Python 3.7+

spotipy (Spotify Web API wrapper for Python)

A Spotify Developer Account

üîß Setup Instructions:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Spotify Developer App

üôå Acknowledgments:
Thanks to Spotipy for simplifying interaction with the Spotify Web API

By working on this, I gained hands-on experience with API authentication, data parsing, and token-based security flows. It also expanded my understanding of how to use third-party libraries and prepare for more complex data extraction and automation workflows.
